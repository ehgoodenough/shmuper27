FRAMERATE UPDATE: To ensure consistent performance across all computers, use the framerate in the gameloop to compensate for different processors by multiplying it against everything.
REOBJEDEX UPDATE: Try to clean up the syntax a bit to make it easier for other objects to reference other objects, to not restrict all objects to uncheckable parameters, and to allow the gameloop to easily update everything. ObjedexEntries?
COMMON FUNCTION UPDATE: If objects with different purposes but similar contexts use identical functions, instantiate it elsewhere and share it between the objects. Inheritence?
