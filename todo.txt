FRAMERATE UPDATE: To ensure consistent performance across all computers, use the framerate in the gameloop to compensate for different processors by multiplying it against everything.
COMMON FUNCTION UPDATE: If objects with different purposes but similar contexts use identical functions, instantiate it elsewhere and share it between the objects. Inheritence?
SORT THE JS UPDATE: Restructure the file system to establish where "classes" and "utilities" are stored.

THE GAME UPDATE:
gameloop? gamestate? gamelevel? gamescreen?!
Aren't some of them supposed to be singletons?
Why instantiate subchildren objects? Reimplement it!
How to load new levels? By creating another object?
